# U3S4 Converting Between Data Types

## Exercise 1
- Create a new project and add the `Casting01.java` file to the project
- Declare and initialize a `byte` with a value of `128`:
  - Observe `NetBeans`’ complaint
  - Comment out this problematic line
- Declare and initialize a `short` with a value of `128`:
  - Create a `print` statement that casts this `short` to a `byte`
- Declare and initialize a `byte` with a value of `127`
  - Add `1` to this variable and print it
  - Add `1` to this variable again and print it again

## Exercise 2
- Create a new project and add the `Casting02.java` file to the project
- There are several errors in this program
- You should be able to fix these errors using …
  - Your knowledge of data types
  - Your knowledge of promotion
  - Your knowledge of casting
## Exercise 2
### Part 1
- Create a new project and add `Parsing01.java` file to the project
- Declare and initialize 3 `String`s with the following data:
    | String Value | Description | Example Values |
    |-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
    | `shirtPrice` | Text to be converted to an **`int`**: | "`15`" |
    | `taxRate` | Text to be converted to a **`double`**: | "`0.05`" |
    | `gibberish` | Gibberish | "`887ds7nds87dsfs`" |
### Part 2
- Parse and multiply `shirtPrice * taxRate` to find the tax
  - Print this value
- Try to parse `taxRate` as an `int`
  - Observe the error message
- Try to parse `gibberish` as an `int`
  - Observe the error message
